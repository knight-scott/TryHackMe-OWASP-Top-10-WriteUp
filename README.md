# OWASP Top 10

## About

This is my write-up for [TryHackMe's OWASP Top 10 Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10). 
!!! note "OWASP"
    The Open Web Application Security Project is a nonprofit foundation focused on understanding web technologies and exploitations and provides resources and tools designed to improve the security of software applications.

The room covers the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) vulnerabilites. The *OWASP Top Ten* is a regularly updated list of the top ten vulnerabilities found in web applications. It is a great starting place for beginning to explore web application research

## Expectations

The room has 31 tasks, however I will not be reproducing them all here. I will reproduce my work for finding the answers to the challenges and recommend that anyone looking to learn these attacks go through the free room for the full experience. 

## Answers

I will do my best to obfuscate answers, however the purpose is to document my steps to exploit the vulnerabilities. Be aware there may be spoilers.
